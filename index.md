# Real Estate

## So you asked Isaac, Evan, or Jasper about getting into Real Estate?
Well here is how to get into it and what to expect

## First Step

Getting your Real Estate license is the easiest part of Real Estate. If you can't do this, then don't bother. The steps to get your license are outlined below.

```markdown
1. Complete the 3 required classes (online or at school)
2. Submit paperwork to the Department of Real Estate (DRE)
3. Wait for state test date
4. Take test
5. Recieve license #
6. Join brokerage (required)
```
### Step 1. Classes
First thing to do is take the 3 required classes (with one being an elective of choice) either online or at school. Taking them at school will take longer since you have to sit through 3 classes for an entire semester(s). Taking them all online is the best approach that we all did. 

There are countless websites out there that are eligible to certify you in the three classes. The website we all used was [retrainersca.com](https://www.retrainersca.com/) (note that we are not affilated with them or anybody mentioned here). Regardless of website you use, you want to make sure that you are taking classes to become a Salesperson and you take all 3 courses (Real Estate Principles, Real Estate Practice, and one elective course). The nice thing about taking them online is you're able to finish each course at your own pace and as fast as you can manage. It took me a week per course including taking the test. I would highly recommend not looking up answers online and completing it as fast as possible... ;). 

Don't worry too much about whether you learn everything from the courses or not. You will not need to remember all of it. The whole idea is to get a general idea for how Real Estate works. 99% of the stuff you learn in the classes is useless for when it comes to actually selling houses. It's a good idea to know it, but not required because over time you will eventually learn most of the main concepts as they come up in real scenarios. 

### Step 2. Submitting paperwork
This part isn't too hard. Simply look up on the DRE website how to submit an application. You're gonna want to make sure you do the salesperson combo application which includes taking the test as well as applying to get your license. A little bit of googling and reading will get you the answers. Also don't forget to include your LiveScan (finger print) with your application. 

### Step 3. Wait for the state test date
The CA DRE takes so damn long to process the applications. On par with the DMV. You can check the processing time frames [here](https://www.dre.ca.gov/Licensees/CurrentTimeframes.html) to see how long it takes for them to process it. Over covid it was about 4 months, but right now you can expect about 2 months for them to process it. You also want to make sure that EVERYTHING in your paperwork is correct so you don't have to wait another 10 years.

While you wait for your test date, you're going to want to study for the test. Listen to me when I say this because it will save you so much time and you will pass the exam first try. Do not study from the books. Study the actual exam questions instead. It's like studying for the SAT, no point in studying the entire math book when you can instead study previous questions. If you took the online courses, the website you bought the courses from should have given you a tool to study with. If not, you can find either quizlets online or other websites that will help you study for the exam.

"How did you study?"
Personally, I used [retrainersca.com CompTrainer](https://www.retrainersca.com/salesperson-state-exam.html) which came with the courses I bought. On the CompuTrainer there was 6 practice exams. I took each one until I got a 95% or better. I also studied it all in only 3 days for a total of 40 hours (don't ask me how...) and memorized all 1200 questions. If you aren't scoring better than at least 90% on each one, make SURE you do on ALL 6 before you take the exam. Trust me and save yourself a walk of shame and a waste of time.

Regardless of what you do to study, don't go into it thinking you can just guess or it'll be alright. This isn't highschool. If you study like I did above, you will pass easily. If not, you won't. I know someone who only studied 4 of the 6 practice exams and thought they would be alright (they didn't pass). 

### Step 4. Take test
Alright, so you studied and feel confident to take the test. By now, you should have already scheduled a test date. You do so through the DRE website after they process your information. So I would study the week or two before your test so the information is still fresh in your head. 

Upon actually taking your test, here is what to expect. The paper with your exam date online should have all the information you need on what to bring so look at that. The test itself it taken in a room on a computer and you will be monitored. You have 3 hours and 15 minutes to complete 150 multiple choice questions. The questions themselves are IDENTICLE to the practice questions from the computrainer except with some slight change in wording. Basically, if you study and memorize the practice questions you will recognize the answer immediatly. It took me 35 minutes to complete all 150 questions and I passed. But if I haven't made it clear: study the practice exams and make sure you get at least 90% or better on all of them. 

### Step 5. Recieve license #
Immediately after your exam, you will know if you passed or not. If you fail (<70%), they will tell you your score. If you pass, they will only tell you "You passed!". They don't tell you your score to discourage brokerages from hiring people who scored x amount or higher, but I'm pretty sure I got at least a 100%. 

You should also recieve your license number shortly after. I forgot to submit my LiveScan with my documents so I had to fax it into the DRE delaying my license by a week, but you can check your status on the DRE website online. 

### Step 6. Join a brokerage
If you studied, you should now know that in order to legally do "Real Estate" you must hang your license under a brokerage. Do not do anything or show houses or talk to buyers/sellers under the impression you're an agent until you have joined a brokerage. 

For actually joining a brokerage, you'll need to basically apply to one as you would with any other job. If you're doing this on your own, go around to a few and see what they have to offer. Do not worry so much about the commission splits. If you join a team/mentor, they'll probably most likely be 50/50 in the beginning. Take this time to learn and be greatful. 

It is highly recommended to join a team/mentor in the beginning because you will have no clue what to do. Yes it's possible to make it on your own, but good luck. From here, it's basically you having to figure the rest out. I can give all the advice and what to do, but your path on which team and brokerage to join is all up to you. 

## Closing notes
Getting your license is the easiest part of Real Estate. Joining a brokerage, learning contracts, joining a team, figuring out how the MLS works, how to make CMAs, finding leads, etc. are all the next steps and hardest part since there is no simple path/way to go about learning it all. A good team/mentor is the most important part of it next to a brokerage who will support you. It should also be noted that you will more than likely not make a lot, if any, money the first year. Remember, traditionally you only get paid when you fully close a deal.

Yes it's possible to make a lot of money, but it's determined by how much effort YOU put into it and how much YOU actually want it. 

This is your own business. Nobody will tell you what to do besides yourself. 90% of agents drop out after their first year because they don't stick with it and/or they don't make any money. 

As long as you believe in yourself and that you will make it, you will.

Good luck
